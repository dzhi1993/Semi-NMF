Semi-NMF (semi non negative matrix factorization algorithm) is developed and used to decompose high dimensional beta value. The beta values were pre-processed from the original sequence scanning fMRI from 24 individuals using super cerebellum project based on paper  (King, Maedbh, et al. "A Multi-Domain Task Battery Reveals Functional Boundaries in the Human Cerebellum." bioRxiv (2018): 423509.) This repository includes semi-NMF, NMF, spectral clustering, and regular k-means clustering algorithms, in order to make a comparison to get the clustering method that can best reflect the functional connectives between human's brain and individual tasks.
